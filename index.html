    <h2><strong>Passion Project (whole brain):</strong></h2>
      <p>
      Soccer is something I am passionate about. It is a great form of exercise and allows me to socialize with people from different demographics that I wouldn't normally meet. It feels good to be part of a team with support and encouragement.I have to think logically in order to play well and make smart decisions on the field. After every game my team plays, we decide on a bar or restaurant to go to for drinks and food. Playing soccer makes me more creative by getting me outside, getting exercise and using problem solving skills to execute plays or try to score.</p>

      <h4>Elevator Pitch</h4>
        <p>Hello! My name is Natalie Woodard. I am interested in creating web or phone applications to help people communicate in different languages. I am doing this to afford a bigger family and to travel more. I am doing this by furthering my education with coding. Are you interested in developing language communication applications?</p>

      <h4>Week1:Reflection</h4>
        <p>What a week! At the beginning of the week I was feeling very overwhelmed, but I am starting to have fun writing code. I am struggling with some things a little, like the snap challenges. I have learned a lot but I still feel pretty lost. I am looking forward to the day this coding stuff makes sense!</p>

			<h4>Week2:Reflection</h4>
				<p>This past week, although it was a short one, felt pretty rough. I've been feeling very tired lately, no matter the amount of sleep I get, and that makes me emotional. I am behind on my object oriented project, and very confused.
					I am looking forward to meeting my tech tutor. Last Friday, we went to an app contest at UNM and it was really fun! I liked the FilmTours app, and spoke with them after their presentation. I suggested that they make a social networking component
					to go along with it, and they liked that idea. My group who carpooled with me and I didn't stay to find out who won, but we had a good time while we were there.</p>
